                <h2>Father</h2>
                <p>My father is the head of our family. He sacrified his entire life for us. My father is a Electrician contractor he worked hard day and night for us . My father never let me realise that we dont have enough money for luxirious life. After his working hours he used to sit with us and teach us,even though he is tiered he used to spend as much as time with me and my sister.My father is kind of opposite person,i still remember the days where my relatives were forcing my dad to marry his daughters soon because we are 2 girl children to our parents, then he bravely answered them that he is not going to do marriages because what matters if the child is girl they need to be independent and marriage is a thing which should bring happiness to them not depending on others. He is also a good support to me,i used feel very bad that i didnt get a job he will sit with me and he says y you are getting dissapointed just work hard dont see for the result it automatically get if you workhard</p>

                <h2>Mother</h2>
                <p>My mother is the backbone of our family. She worked as a teacher for 5 years and left her job for family. She takes care of everyone in the family she cooks food,she solves my every problem,she is a helping hand for me, she used to make me study and what not.Whenever i go through any situation my mom is always back of me and keeps supporting me.When she was working she doesnt get time to be with us, she used to make us study till late nights(great efforts where only mom can give that).No matter how big i grow she still treats me like a little kid. No matter what which and where she always makes me feel comfortable. She encourages me in every situation. even my father rejects anything my mother she always says give a try.</p>

                <h2>Sister</h2>
                <p>My sister is  someone who is caring, supportive, and responsible. She is always there for me for a helpful advice. She is a source of guidance for me. The unbreakable bond we share with our sister makes it even more special. Having a sibling makes our younger days even more fun and memorable. It is so much fun to go back home and share something with someone other than parents. I remembered she used to sit with me during my exams and used to teach me. I never liked studying too late in the nights but she used to make me sit and dont leave me until i finish my syllabus.</p>
